The course focuses on core areas such as game programming, gameplay mechanics, gameengines, prototyping, interactive systems, and collaborative development workflows, while also introducing students to game design theory and player experience. Through hands-on projects,studio-based learning, and industry-informed briefs, students learn how to develop playable games from concept to completion, working both independently and in multidisciplinary teams. \
    Graduates leave with a strong technical foundation, a professional portfolio of completed projects, and the ability to design, build, test, and refine interactive games, apply programming and development principles effectively, collaborate within production environments, and adapt their skills for careers in game development, interactive media, or related technology-driven creative industries."
